Palmer & Krumhansl 1987
=======================

*Independent Temporal and Pitch Structures in Determination of Musical Phrases*

*Pitch and temporal contributions to musical phrase perception: Effects of harmony, performance timing, and familiarity*

:data-y: r1500
:data-x: r0

Experiment 1
------------

Measuring judgment of completeness of temporal only, pitch only, and melody (temporal + pitch).

**Independent variables:**

- Stimuli type (temporal, pitch, or melody).
- Ending note.

**Dependent variable:** judgment of completeness on a scale of 1 to 7 (a la Krumhansl).

Main effect for ending note. No main effect for stimuli type. Significant interaction between variables, "indicating different effects of pitch and temporal information". Significant correlation between melody and other stimuli types. No correlation between temporal and pitch conditions.

Surprisingly, melodic rating profile can be derived algorithmically from two simpler profiles with linear regression!

Experiment 2
------------

Instead of separating the conditions as in experiment 1 they anchored one condition and shifted the other with all possible shifts. Results were collapsed around non shifted condition (see figure).

Supports the results of experiment 1.

*Really really nice! Why the linear combination coefficients are not presented? they might be interesting. Should be reproduced with more diverse musical material.*

Palmer & Krumhansl 1987b
------------------------

Very similar to Palmer & Krumhansl 1987a.

**Differences:**

- New musical excerpt (Mozart K. 331 piano sonata), now includes harmonic part.
- Familiarity with the musical excerpt taken into account (new independent variable).
- Analysis of correlations with tonal predictions from Krumhansl & Kesler 1982.
- Analysis of correlations with metrical accent predictions from Lerdahl & Jackendoff 1983.
- Analysis of correlations with time-span (grouping) predictions from Lerdahl & Jackendoff.

----

Experiment 1
------------

The results of Palmer & Krumhansl 1987a experiment 1 were replicated. In addition:

- For familiar listeners pitch and temporal conditions correlate.
- Tonal predictions are highly correlated with pitch and combined conditions.
- Metrical accent predictions are highly correlated with temporal and combined condition for unfamiliar listeners and with temporal condition for familiar listeners.
- Time-span predictions are highly correlated with combined condition.

----

Experiment 2
------------

The results of Palmer & Krumhansl 1987a experiment 2 were replicated with one minor difference - temporal condition response is now correlated with pitch condition response. In addition:

- Tonal predictions are highly correlated only with pitch condition for familiar listeners.
- Metrical predictions are highly correlated with temporal and combined conditions.
- Time-span predictions are highly correlated with combined condition.

----

Experiments 3 & 4
-----------------

Same as experiments 1 & 2 but with live performance durations. Generally, got the same results. Correlations with predictions varied.

----

Conclusions
-----------

As in Palmer & Krumhansl 1987a, with minor addition: "the relationship between pitch and temporal components differed with familiarity with the music... When one component was presented without the other, listeners familiar with the excerpt reported imagery for the missing component and tended to have higher correlations between pitch and temporal ratings than did listeners unfamiliar with the excerpt".

----

Criticism
---------

No explanations why correlations with predictions got different significance between experiments.

About stats: the authors conclude that all experiments support the same general ideas. If they were collapsing the data across experiments they will get much less significance between predictions and data, but the significant correlations will be more reliable. In general, it look like they measure significance of each correlation by it own, without balancing the measurements.

This study is more complicated than 1987a and therefore introduce more issue. Thereby, 1987a looks nicer, but maybe it's just the simplicity. Overall, 1987b have no major added value.
